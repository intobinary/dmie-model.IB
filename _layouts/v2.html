					<p>"Effective economic research connects data to society by uncovering the hidden structures that shape people’s lives."</p>
					
					<p>Donatien Malala is a renowned economist whose work focuses on understanding and quantifying the parts of the economy that traditional models overlook. His research brings clarity to complex economic systems, turning invisible activity into measurable insight.</p>
					
					<p>The project combines mathematical rigor with real-world relevance, producing models that are not only analytically strong but practically valuable for policymakers, development institutions, and fellow researchers.</p>
					
					<p>As a researcher and economic model designer, Donatien develops the conceptual framework, constructs the analytical mechanisms, and guides the full research process from theory to applied results.</p>
					
					<p>He is known for being precise, innovative, and deeply thoughtful — qualities that shape the strength of his work. Every assumption is intentional, every variable is examined, and every model is built with purpose.</p>
					
					<p>Donatien believes in producing research that is impact-driven: work that informs decisions, challenges outdated assumptions, and better reflects the lived economic reality of millions.</p>

					<p>His contributions include the development of the DMIE Model (Diophantine Model of Informal Economy), a groundbreaking approach introduced in his 2025 research that offers a new way to estimate the informal economy through mathematical structures.</p>
					
					<p>Donatien Malala’s research legacy continues to expand through collaborations with global scholars, policy advisors, and institutions exploring the dynamics of emerging and informal markets.</p>
