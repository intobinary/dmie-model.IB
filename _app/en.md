  title: "THE WORLD THROUGH THE EYES OF THE WEST"
  text: "For decades, the global economy has been measured by standards and models largely shaped in the global north. Across textbooks, financial reports, and global institutions, the rules of data are drawn through the cultures of the west. Everything is built around recorded numbers: taxed salaries, registered businesses, formal productivity."

  title: "THE ECONOMY BEYOND THE FORMAL"
  text: "Step into a market in Kinshasa, Lagos, or Lusaka. You'll find traders, craftsmen, gig workers, street vendors, all moving products, serving communities, and generating real value, without ever appearing in the official records. <br /><br /> In many African countries, the informal sector is not the fringe of the economy, it is the economy. Yet, they do not appear in the official GDP statistics. They are invisible to central banks, and hence can hardly be planned for in government planning. <br /><br />Wehn we bring the western models to Africa, CHAOS. What isn't recorded doesn't count. What isn't taxed doesn't exist. And what isn't part of the a government ledger is dismissed as noise."
w3:
  title: "THE LIMITS OF THE OFFICIAL MEASUREMENTS"
  text: "To be clear, formal data is crucial. But in many African economies, it's only a small part of the story. Conventional economic models ignore our reality. And ignoring the informal economy here doesn't just make the numbers inaccurate, it also makes policies ineffective. Ac ountry that looks 'poor' on paper may, in truth, have a buzzing informal economy sustaining millions."

  title: "A FORMULA FOR THE UNCOUNTED"
  text: "Ths is where DMIE, the Diophantine Model of Informal Economy, steps in. Instead of dismissing what we can't see, the model applies a mathematical approach rooted in demographic and productivity indicators, calculating what formal statistics overlook. <br /><br />The DMIE Model is a way to mathematically estimate what has long been economically ignored, a way to bring the invisible informal economy into view."

  title: "A DIFFERENT KIND OF MATH"
  text: "With just a few available indicators (workforce numbers, productivity, GDP, tax pressure) the model solves the missing piece. <br /><br />.Yin: Informal GDP <br />.Yt: Total GDP (Official + Informal) <br />.Yin-percent: Informal as % of Official GDP <br /><br />The equation processes real world variables like: <br />.WF: Working Population <br />.FW: Formal Workers <br />.IW: Informal Workers <br />. Yof: Official GDP <br />.FP/IP: Productivity levels of formal vs informal sectors <br />.OL: Tax pressure <br /><br />{Post research paper, downloadable pdf}"

  text: "African doesn't lack productivity. We lack recognition in our unique ways within our lands. It's about admitting that conventional methods don't capture our full economic picture, and offering a credible, computable, and African-rooted alternative. <br /><br />The DMIE Model gives governments, economists, and planners a clearer, more inclusive view of national productivity, especially where informality is prevalent. <br /><br />Ro use the find, _______."
